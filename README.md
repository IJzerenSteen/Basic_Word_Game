# Basic_Word_Game
This is a basic Python project.

This project includes a basic wording game. 
E
very new word should start with the last word's last letter. 
And, your new words should not be repeated your one of your last words. 

I used one general while loop and if conditions. 

There is a list for not repeating the words.

I also added a file that all new words are saved in. 
When the player loses the game, the file is deleted itself.

Enjoy.
